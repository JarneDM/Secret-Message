> **1.** It asks the message we wants to encode in example it is "coding is fun". <br/>
> **2.** It asks us what the secret key value it should be. <br/>
> **3.** It shows us the encoded message.<br/>
> **4.** It asks us if we would like to decode a message. In this case we said yes(y). <br/>
> **5.** Here we enter the message we want to decode. In this case it is the encoded message **[3]**. <br/>
> **6.** As you see we need to enter the same key value as we chose to encode the message. Otherwise it won't work. <br/>
> **7.** And here you can see the decoded message.
